# PROFILE SUMMARY
A keen writer who seeks to engage deeply with words. With an academic background in engineering and years of professional experience in the technical domain as a Consultant, I have long operated at the intersection of logic and communication. During a reflective career break, I gravitated toward writing more earnestly, pursuing certifications in technical and content writing to give structure to an interest that had always lingered. Now, I stand at a thoughtful crossroads, where fiction meets functionality and storytelling meets strategy, bridging my analytical roots with my creative pursuits.
